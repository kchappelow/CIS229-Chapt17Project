2. Use the encrypted.dat file as the encyrpted file.
3. Use FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream, FileOutputStream, and BufferedOutputStream classes reading and writing each integer.
		
## Tasks
* Code: Write a program to decrypt the file.
* Can your program read bytes from the file?
* Can your program subtract 5 from each byte?
* Can your program write the new bytes to the output file?
* Did your program close the files?
* Submit your program and the unencrypted file you created using git.
